Zen Photos -- A React Native Solo Project and Tutorial

This is a front-end only tutorial in the basic components of React Native. 

It is meant to be a strictly ephemeral project that captures and releases impressions, not save everything in a traditional journal. In this way, it mimics meditation practices in which you observe thoughts, then release them.
